# Willow Creek Wildlife Park

Willow Creek Wildlife Park is a multi-page informational website built with HTML and CSS to showcase a fictional wildlife park experience — complete with exhibits, special events, dining options, and visitor registration features.

This project was created as a front-end development exercise and portfolio piece, designed to demonstrate clean structure, thoughtful navigation, and cohesive visual design.

## About the Project

This static website simulates a full wildlife park experience, including:

- A welcoming homepage introducing the park
- Linked exhibit pages featuring animals and special attractions
- Dining options with individual restaurant detail pages
- A visitor registration form with a confirmation page
- An interactive park map with clickable regions that navigate to different sections of the site

All pages are handcrafted using semantic HTML and styled with CSS to create a clear, organized, and user-friendly layout.

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of the primary files and their roles:

```text
Willow-Creek-Wildlife-Park/
├── index.html — Home and main navigation
├── catalog.html — List of exhibits and sections
├── restaurants.html — Dining options overview
├── restaurant1.html — Restaurant detail page
├── restaurant2.html — Restaurant detail page
├── registration.html — Visitor signup form
├── thank-you.html — Form submission confirmation page
├── map.html — Interactive park map
├── styles.css — Primary stylesheet
└── Additional feature pages — Event details, exhibits, etc.
```

## How to View Locally

No special setup or server is required — this is a fully static site.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wezy18/Willow-Creek-Wildlife-Park.git
```
2. Open ```index.html``` in your preferred web browser.

From there, use the navigation menu to explore the various sections of the site.

## Built With

This project was developed using:

- HTML5 — For semantic structure and content organization
- CSS3 — For styling, layout, and visual consistency

No frameworks or external libraries are required.

## Purpose

This project was built to:

- Practice structuring a multi-page HTML website
- Strengthen layout, navigation, and design skills
- Demonstrate responsive and semantic front-end development principles

It serves as both a hands-on learning experience and a portfolio example showcasing foundational front-end skills.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future development include:

- Adding JavaScript for interactive features (form validation, dynamic navigation, modal popups)
- Improving mobile responsiveness with media queries
- Implementing accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, improved contrast, keyboard navigation)
- Converting the site into a dynamic application using a backend framework
- Adding a database to store visitor registration data
- Enhancing the interactive park map with hover effects and animations
- 
## Notes

- This project does not include backend functionality; all interactions are static.
- The site can be expanded by integrating JavaScript or server-side features.
- Images and assets should be organized within project folders using relative paths.
