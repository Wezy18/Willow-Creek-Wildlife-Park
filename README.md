# Willow Creek Wildlife Park

Willow Creek Wildlife Park is a multi-page informational website built with HTML and CSS to showcase a fictional wildlife park experience — complete with exhibits, events, dining options, and registration features. This project was created as a front-end learning exercise and portfolio piece.

## About the Project

This static website simulates a wildlife park with:

- A homepage introducing the park
- Linked exhibit pages featuring animals and special events
- Dining options with individual restaurant detail pages
- A visitor registration form with a confirmation page
- An interactive park map with clickable regions that navigate to different sections of the site

All pages are handcrafted with semantic HTML and styled using CSS to create a simple, clean, and navigable layout.
